# HuXa Build Roadmap

## Phase 8 — Native App (learning project)

- [x] Pick a framework (Expo / React Native) and set up the project
- [x] Connect to existing backend API (bearer token auth)
- [x] Replicate core logging flow (category → compose → submit)
- [x] Replicate history view with editing
- [x] Replicate diary flow
- [x] Explore native-only features (push notifications, haptics, etc.)

### App Testing Checklist

**Logging**
- [x] quick entry, gut status text is indented

**Offline**
- [x] Test if offline pending messages sync automatically when back online
- [x] Show a list of pending (queued) offline events in the app

## Phase 8.1 — Expo Web Support (replace HTML frontend)

- [x] Install `react-native-web` and `react-dom`
- [x] Get `npx expo start --web` running
- [x] Handle web-incompatible components (e.g. `DateTimePicker` needs conditional rendering or web alternative)
- [ ] Retire `03_frontend/` HTML version — one codebase for iOS, Android, and web

## Phase 8.2 — Rebrand to HuXa

- [x] Rename app throughout codebase (frontend, app, backend, configs)
- [x] Rename server dirs and service files
- [x] Buy huxa.is domain
- [ ] Update Cloudflare DNS and nginx for new domain
- [ ] New app icon and branding

## Phase 10 — Standalone App on iPhone

- [ ] Get Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- [ ] Install EAS CLI (`npm install -g eas-cli`)
- [ ] Configure `eas.json` and app signing
- [ ] App icon and splash screen
- [ ] Build standalone `.ipa` with `eas build --platform ios`
- [ ] Distribute via TestFlight for personal use
- [ ] (Optional) Submit to App Store for public distribution

## Phase 11 — Cloudflare App Lockdown

- [ ] Set up Cloudflare Access or app lockdown (replace IP lockdown)

## Phase 12 — Feature Ideas / Bug Reports

- [ ] Add in-app feature to log a feature idea or bug report
- [ ] Store in separate JSONL or send to GitHub Issues

## Phase 13 — Multi-User (Google OAuth)

- [ ] Add Google OAuth login (backend endpoints for auth flow, JWT sessions)
- [ ] Per-user JSONL storage (`/var/lib/huxa/users/{email}/events.jsonl` and `diary.jsonl`)
- [ ] Add Google login to native app and web frontend
- [ ] Replace bearer token with OAuth session
- [ ] Remove token UI from web frontend (settings gear, token dialog)

## Phase 14 — Dark / Light Mode

- [ ] Add theme toggle to app and web frontend
- [ ] Persist preference in AsyncStorage / localStorage

## Phase 15 — Smart Query (Embeddings / RAG)

The current `/query` endpoint sends the entire event log to GPT. At ~10 events/day, the log will exceed GPT-4o-mini's 128K token context window within 6-12 months. An embeddings-based approach finds only the relevant events for each query, making it scale to years of data without hitting token limits.

- [ ] Compute embeddings for events on ingest (OpenAI or local model)
- [ ] Store embeddings (vector file or lightweight vector DB)
- [ ] Query by similarity: find relevant events, send only those to GPT
- [ ] Fallback: add date range filter to `/query` endpoint as interim solution
