# HuXa Build Roadmap

## Phase 10 — Standalone App on iPhone

- [ ] Get Apple Developer account ($99/year) — waiting for confirmation
- [ ] Install EAS CLI (`npm install -g eas-cli`)
- [ ] Configure `eas.json` and app signing
- [ ] App icon and splash screen
- [ ] Build standalone `.ipa` with `eas build --platform ios`
- [ ] Distribute via TestFlight for personal use
- [ ] (Optional) Submit to App Store for public distribution

## Phase 11 — Cloudflare App Lockdown

- [ ] Set up Cloudflare Access or app lockdown (replace IP lockdown)

## Phase 13 — Multi-User (Google OAuth)

- [ ] Add Google OAuth login (backend endpoints for auth flow, JWT sessions)
- [ ] Per-user JSONL storage (`/var/lib/huxa/users/{email}/events.jsonl` and `diary.jsonl`)
- [ ] Add Google login to native app and web frontend
- [ ] Replace bearer token with OAuth session
- [ ] Remove token UI from web frontend (settings gear, token dialog)

## Phase 14 — Dark / Light Mode

- [ ] Add theme toggle to app and web frontend
- [ ] Persist preference in AsyncStorage / localStorage

## Phase 15 — Smart Query (Embeddings / RAG)

The current `/query` endpoint sends the entire event log to GPT. At ~10 events/day, the log will exceed GPT-4o-mini's 128K token context window within 6-12 months. An embeddings-based approach finds only the relevant events for each query, making it scale to years of data without hitting token limits.

- [ ] Compute embeddings for events on ingest (OpenAI or local model)
- [ ] Store embeddings (vector file or lightweight vector DB)
- [ ] Query by similarity: find relevant events, send only those to GPT
- [ ] Fallback: add date range filter to `/query` endpoint as interim solution

## Phase 16 — Voice Input (Whisper)

- [ ] Add voice-to-text for logging and diary entry
- [ ] Evaluate on-device vs server-side transcription
- [ ] Integrate with compose and diary text inputs
