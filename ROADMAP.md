# HuXa Build Roadmap

## Standalone App on iPhone

- [ ] Get Apple Developer account ($99/year) — waiting for confirmation
- [ ] Install EAS CLI (`npm install -g eas-cli`)
- [ ] Configure `eas.json` and app signing
- [ ] App icon and splash screen
- [ ] Build standalone `.ipa` with `eas build --platform ios`
- [ ] Distribute via TestFlight for personal use
- [ ] (Optional) Submit to App Store for public distribution

## Cloudflare App Lockdown

- [ ] Set up Cloudflare Access or app lockdown (replace IP lockdown)

## Multi-User (Google OAuth + Apple Sign-In)

### Provider Setup
- [ ] Create Google Cloud project + OAuth 2.0 client IDs (web, iOS, Android)
- [ ] Enable "Sign In with Apple" on Apple Developer account + create Service ID for web
- [ ] Generate JWT secret for session tokens

### Backend Auth
- [ ] Add Python deps: `PyJWT`, `cryptography`, `google-auth`, `httpx`
- [ ] Create `02_backend/app/auth.py` — Google/Apple ID token verification, JWT issuance, user registry (`users.jsonl`), `get_current_user` dependency
- [ ] Create `02_backend/app/routes/auth.py` — `POST /auth/google`, `POST /auth/apple`, `GET /auth/me`
- [ ] Register auth router in `main.py`

### Per-User Data
- [ ] Per-user JSONL storage (`/var/lib/huxa/users/{user_id}/events.jsonl`, `diary.jsonl`, `feedback.jsonl`)
- [ ] Refactor `main.py`: replace `verify_token` with `get_current_user`, route data to per-user dirs
- [ ] Keep legacy bearer token working during transition

### Migration
- [ ] Create `05_scripts/migrate_to_multiuser.py` — copy existing data to legacy user directory
- [ ] Run migration on server

### Expo App
- [ ] Add deps: `expo-auth-session`, `expo-crypto`, `expo-web-browser`, `expo-apple-authentication`
- [ ] Replace manual token input with login screen (Google + Apple buttons)
- [ ] Google OAuth flow via `expo-auth-session` (web, iOS, Android)
- [ ] Apple Sign-In via `expo-apple-authentication` (iOS native) + `expo-auth-session` (web)
- [ ] Store JWT in AsyncStorage, verify on startup via `/auth/me`
- [ ] Update settings screen: show user info, sign out button, remove token input

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Add `/auth` location block to Nginx config (tighter rate limit)
- [ ] Add env vars to systemd: `HUXA_JWT_SECRET`, `HUXA_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `HUXA_APPLE_SERVICE_ID`

### Cleanup
- [ ] Remove legacy bearer token support after confirming OAuth works
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md (single-user → multi-user, bearer token → JWT/OAuth)

## Dark / Light Mode

- [ ] Add theme toggle to app and web frontend
- [ ] Persist preference in AsyncStorage / localStorage

## Smart Query (Embeddings / RAG)

The current `/query` endpoint sends the entire event log to GPT. At ~10 events/day, the log will exceed GPT-4o-mini's 128K token context window within 6-12 months. An embeddings-based approach finds only the relevant events for each query, making it scale to years of data without hitting token limits.

- [ ] Compute embeddings for events on ingest (OpenAI or local model)
- [ ] Store embeddings (vector file or lightweight vector DB)
- [ ] Query by similarity: find relevant events, send only those to GPT
- [ ] Fallback: add date range filter to `/query` endpoint as interim solution

## Landing Page

- [ ] Public welcome page at huxa.is for unauthenticated visitors
- [ ] App description, screenshots, and feature overview
- [ ] Links to App Store / TestFlight
- [ ] Documentation / getting started guide

## Voice Input (Whisper)

- [ ] Add voice-to-text for logging and diary entry
- [ ] Evaluate on-device vs server-side transcription
- [ ] Integrate with compose and diary text inputs
